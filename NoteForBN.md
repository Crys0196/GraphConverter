To make the graph more concise, we choose the current_time at 5, 6, 7.

Use the conditional probability in Bayes Tree, there is a really easy way to get the parent-child relationship among nodes.

The graphs below are the Bayes Networks in EuRoc data MH_03 by using Kimera-VIO. In fact these are not the concrete networks because it's an incremental process where the previous optimized results are the dependencies of the next time.

The component of Root is quite familiar: the state vector during the slot and the optimizing object bias b and noise v.
